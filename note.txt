!! what I learned !!

//HTML
1. favicon
- A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.
=> Its main purpose is to help visitors locate a page easier when users have multiple tabs open.
=> If there is no favicon in html, there is an error for favicon like this(GET http://127.0.0.1:5500/favicon.ico 404 (Not Found))

//css
1. background center/cover
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background)
- it means background-position: center, background-size: cover.

2. 'display: none' vs 'visibility: hidden'
- both properties make elements invisible.
=> 'display:none' turs off the layout and doesn't render elements, but 'visibility:hidden' renders and hides elements without changing layouts.

3. why using builder pattern
- The most common motivation for using Builder is to simplify client code that creates
  complex objects.
=> It clearly distinguishes between essential and optional factors for creating objects.

4. what is bind() e.g) function.prototype.bind()
- The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
=> If not bind, this will be not included and not passed.
=> or can use arrow functions.

5. object.freeze()
- Freezing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable and non-configurable.
=> It prevents mistakes and any changes.

6. 'use strict'
(https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp#)
- In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.

7. Audio()
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio)
- The Audio() constructor creates and returns a new HTMLAudioElement which can be either attached to a document for the user to interact with and/or listen to, or can be used offscreen to manage and play audio.
